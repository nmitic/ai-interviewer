Resource sounds like something you can toss aside if you decide it's not doing the trick for you. You look at the past few years and all those mass layoffs, and it seems like that decision is often way off the mark. Meaning, it is very hard to be accurate with the judgment of who you need and do not.\\\\nSure, companies aren't our families, but they are communities of people thrown together to chase after some shared good.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"a4be8e95-aea9-46ed-ad0e-70db70a34498":{"id_":"a4be8e95-aea9-46ed-ad0e-70db70a34498","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"75f4a025-0981-42f4-b982-e94a0840195b","metadata":{},"hash":"JZ7o46fd2h0JWf3vkVVrWXGZpeH1yj7PMYwJF4j0CTo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8aeaa176-a9e9-4a36-903b-385d18a6c135","metadata":{},"hash":"zRb3y51nD0hapgKUEKIGnM7vm0QZjYYFI6XQ80gyiMA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"70d76948-1777-4f23-9ef0-5bc88158bd0c","metadata":{},"hash":"7a2KMslEjHnqShd7TFY9An9+FcDUbfF2R5iksZnJ9jk="}},"hash":"V9mR7xyeg86zhYu79m6awNllN41Pxb1HNw0tmBT5kmA=","text":"At least, that's my hope ‚Äì that we'd build companies on that kind of idea.\\\\nSo, if I'm not your human resource, what am I?\\\\nI'm your community member, not working for you, but working toward a common goal together with you.\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nI need your help, you need my help.

I can also reflect on how it was done in my previous roles.\\\\nThe answer usually involves some kind of metric that measures the amount of work done, speed, or the number of introduced bugs, among other things.\\\\nMeasuring performance this way is suboptimal; it doesn't tell you much about how the work contributes to the team's overall goals.\\\\nThe problem isn't with the metrics used or how they're measured; it's about what is being measured in the first place.\\\\nHere's my proposal:\\\\nInstead of measuring the performance of an individual contributor, we should measure the impact they have on various aspects of the business.\\\\nHow much did an individual's work contribute to increases in certain business metrics?\\\\nHow quickly were they able to accurately execute a plan, from its creation to completion?\\\\nHow innovative are they? In simple terms, how many out-of-the-box solutions did they provide that gave the business a competitive advantage?\\\\nJust to name a few.\\\\nWhy isn't this done more often? Well, it means that metrics can't always be described in numbers. It requires a manager who is willing to work with more than just data, understanding their team and each individual. It takes judgment based on a manager's experience with the team. It needs a manager who is willing to delegate and trust their subordinates. It requires a culture that gives a high degree of ownership and autonomy in daily tasks. It also takes highly motivated individuals who are willing to give their best.\"}},{\"content\":{\"text\":\"Resume driven development must be stopped!\"}},{\"content\":{\"text\":\"I always thought that all you need to have a job and get paid for it is to work hard, work smart, work efficiently, and work on the right things.\\\\nRecent layoffs showed all of us that this is far from the truth.\\\\nCompanies are investor-pleasing machines, not problem-solving institutions.
